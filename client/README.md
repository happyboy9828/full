# DocFix

Fast, secure image tools that run 100% in your browser. Nothing is uploaded to a server — every tool reads your file with the File API and writes the result back with a Blob URL.

- **Next.js 16** · **React 19** · **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **Zero uploads** · **No sign-up** · **Free**

## Analytics Dashboard (Phase 5-7)

**`/analytics`** — Private analytics dashboard for site owners (in development).

- **Phase 5**: Tracking client (page loads, navigation, clicks, heartbeats, dedupe, consent)
- **Phase 6**: Admin authentication (login, HttpOnly cookies, session management)
- **Phase 7**: Dashboard UI (overview, sources, pages, devices, events, live, time-series, CSV export)

The dashboard is powered by a separate Express + MongoDB backend (`../backend/`) with privacy-first design: no raw IPs, URL sanitization, PII scrubbing, consent support.

---

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build
npm run start    # serve the production build
npm run lint     # eslint
```

**Known build issue**: `client/utils/shared/download.js` is currently commented out (pre-existing). Fix required for `npm run build` to pass.

---

## Adding a tool

1. Create `app/img/<ToolName>/page.js`. The route folder **must** use the same casing as the tool folder — on a case-sensitive filesystem a mismatch breaks the build.
2. Add the tool's title and description to `PAGE_META` in `lib/pages.js`. Routes are discovered from the filesystem, so the nav and home page pick it up automatically, but this is what gives it a readable name.
3. Add `app/img/<ToolName>/layout.js` exporting `metadata` from `toolMetadata`. Tool pages are client components and cannot export metadata themselves.

---

## Project structure

```
app/              Next.js App Router routes and each tool's implementation
components/       shared React components (Navbar, Footer, pricing, ads, etc.)
lib/pages.js      route discovery + the single source of truth for titles and descriptions
utils/shared/     helpers used by every tool (see below)
utils/img/        image tool utilities (BGRemove, FavIcon, etc.)
utils/dev-tools/  dev tool utilities (CSSMinifier, HTMLMinifier, PasswordGenerator, QRCodeGenerator, QRCodeScanner)
ads/              ad units (banner, popup, push notification, etc.)
```

### Shared helpers

`utils/shared/` exists so the tools do not each grow their own copy of the same utilities. Import from here rather than re-implementing:

- `download.js` — `downloadBlob(blob, filename)`
- `format.js` — `formatBytes`, `savingsPercent`, `clamp`, `baseName`, `withExtension`, `MAX_FILES`, `nextFrame`, `sleep`
- `imageFile.js` — `kindOf`, `isAcceptedFile`, `ACCEPT_ATTR`, `loadImage`, `canvasToBlob`, `canvasToBytes`, `canEncode`
- `zip.js` — `createZip`, `createZipFromBlobs`, `crc32`, `deflate`, `encodeText`

### Conventions

- **React components use JSX.** Plain-DOM helpers inside `utils/` use a local `h`/`el` helper. Do not use `createElement` for components: the React Compiler lint rules cannot see through it and will reject every ref.
- **Two component styles are intentional.** New tools should be React with hooks. The imperative tools (`ImgToBase64`, `JpgToPng`, `PngToJpg`, `WebpToPng` in `utils/img/`, and `CSSMinifier`, `HTMLMinifier`, `PasswordGenerator`, `QRCodeGenerator`, `QRCodeScanner` in `utils/dev-tools/`) build their DOM in a `mount*` or `create*` function that returns a cleanup; their pages just call it from a `useEffect`. Keep new tools on the React side.
- **Double quotes** in JS and CSS.
- **Own your root element.** `app/layout.js` renders the single `<main>`, so a page renders a `<div class="<prefix>-page">`, never another `<main>`.
- **CSS custom property prefixes.** Each tool scopes its styles (`rb-`, `fg-`, `ci-`, `itb-`, `j2p-`, `p2j-`, `w2p-`, `cm-`, `hm-`, `pg-`, `qrt-`, `qrs-`) but reads the shared `--tool-width`, `--tool-font` and `--tool-mono` from `app/globals.css` so all tools line up.

---

## Themes

The site supports three themes via CSS custom properties on `:root`:

- **Light** — Cool slate surfaces with deep charcoal text and indigo accents
- **Dark** — Deep navy background with light slate text and blue accents
- **Neon** — High-contrast dark with electric cyan accents

Theme preference is persisted in `localStorage` and applied with the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.

---

## Ads & monetisation

Ad units live under `ads/` and are mounted once in `app/layout.js` so triggers are configured in a single place:

- **AdBanner** — leaderboard banner
- **AdInArticle** — sponsored content block
- **AdPopup** — timed modal popup
- **AdOnClick** — triggers after a deliberate number of clicks
- **AdPagePushBanner** — corner banner that auto-hides
- **AdPushNotification** — browser push-request consent card

---

## Download Progress Popup

The `DownloadProgressPopup` is mounted globally in `layout.js`. Tools trigger it via the `useDownloadProgress` hook:

```javascript
// In your tool component (client-side)
import { useDownloadProgress } from '@/components/ads/DownloadProgressPopup/DownloadProgressPopup';

function MyTool() {
  const { trigger, DownloadProgressPopup } = useDownloadProgress();

  const handleDownload = () => {
    const blob = await generateFile();
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const filename = 'output.pdf';

    trigger({
      countdownMs: 5000,
      durationMs: 3000,
      title: 'Preparing your PDF',
      description: 'Your merged document is being generated.',
      onDownloadStart: () => {
        const a = document.createElement('a');
        a.href = url;
        a.download = filename;
        a.click();
        URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleDownload}>Download</button>
      <DownloadProgressPopup />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Features:**
- 5-second countdown (configurable via `countdownMs`) before download starts
- Progress animation (configurable via `durationMs`) simulates 0→100%
- Auto-closes after completion (configurable via `autoCloseMs`)
- Accessible with ARIA live regions for countdown announcements
- Theme-aware uses CSS variables (light/dark/neon)
